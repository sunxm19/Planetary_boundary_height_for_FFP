# Planetary_boundary_height_for_Kljun_FFP_footprint_model
extracting boundary height within North America from NOAA regional data (Only North American), used for Kljun Eddy Covaraince footprint model. 

This code serves as a supplementary file to Kljun's foortprint model for eddy covarainces system.

  A simple two-dimensional parameterisation for Flux Footprint Prediction (FFP), Geosci. Model Dev., 8, 3695-3713, 2015. 
  
They might need some improvement, especially the latitude and longitude are in an (uncommon) Northern Lambert Conformal Conic grid. I provide a work-around suggestion in my code. I will try to see whether I can figure out the equation for the coordinate conversion later.
